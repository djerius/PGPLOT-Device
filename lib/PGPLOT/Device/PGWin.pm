=method new

  $pgwin = PGPLOT::Device::PGWin->new( \%opts );

Create a new object.  The possible options are:

=over

=item device

The device specification.  This is passed directly to
L<PGPLOT::Device/new>, so see its documentation.

=item devopts

A hashref containing options to pass to L<PGPLOT::Device/new>.

=item winopts

A hashref containing options to pass to
L<PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Windows/new>.  Do not include a C<Device>
option as that will break things.

        $win->{CurrentPanel} = $NX * $NY;
    }
}

=method device

  $dev = $pgwin->device

This method returns the underlying L<PGPLOT::Device> object.

=cut

sub device { $_[0]->{device} }

=method next

  $win = $pgwin->next( ?\%winopts, ?$spec  );

Return the window handle to use for constructing the next plot.  If the device
is not changing, simply returns the existing window handle.

=over

=item C<%winopts>

If C<%winopts> is provided, it will be used to replace the previous
set of window options. To merely amend that, set

  %winopts = ( %{ $pgwin->winopts }, %newoptions );

If the device is not changing, some poking at
PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window innards must be performed so that the
current window will pay attention to the new options.  Only the
following options are handled:

  Justify NXPanel NYPanel

=item C<$spec>

If the optional argument C<$spec> is provided, it is
equivalent to

  $pgwin->override( $spec );
  $pgwin->next;

=cut

sub next {
    my $self = shift;
    my $winopts = 'HASH' eq ref $_[0] ? shift : undef;

    $self->override( @_ ) if @_;

    # prompt user before displaying second and subsequent plots if
    # a new plot will erase the previous one
    PGPLOT::pgask( $self->{device}->ask )
      if $self->{not_first}++;

    if ( $self->{device}->would_change ) {
        $self->finish;
        $self->{winopts} = { %$winopts } if defined $winopts;
        $self->{win} = PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window->new( {
                Device => $self->{device}->next,
                %{ $self->{winopts} } } );
    }
    else {
        $self->_update_winopts( $winopts ) if defined $winopts;
    }

    $self->{win};
}

=method override

  $pgwin->override( ... );

This calls the B<override> method of the associated
L<PGPLOT::Device> object.

=cut

sub override {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{device}->override( @_ );
}

=method finish

  $pgwin->finish();

Close the associated device.  This must be called to handle prompting
for ephemeral interactive graphic devices before a program finishes
execution.

This is B<not> automatically called upon object destruction as there
seems to be an ordering problem in destructors called during Perl's
cleanup phase such that the underlying
L<PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window> object is destroyed I<before> this
object.

=cut
sub finish {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    # make sure that the plot stays up until the user is done with it
    if ( defined $self->{win} ) {
        PGPLOT::pgask( 1 ) if $self->{device}->is_ephemeral;
        $self->{win}->close;
    }

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $pgwin = PGPLOT::Device::PGWin->new( { device => $user_device_spec,
                                         winopts => \%opts } );

  $pgwin->override( $override );
  $win = $pgwin->next;
  $win->env( ... );

  $pgwin->finish;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<PGPLOT::Device::PGWin> is a convenience class which combines
L<PGPLOT::Device> and L<PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window>.  It provides
the logic to handle interactive devices (as illustrated in the
Examples section of the B<PGPLOT::Device> documentation).

Note that the L<PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window/close> method should
B<never> be called when using this module, as that will surely mess
things up.


=head1 METHODS


=head1 EXAMPLES

  my $pgwin = PGPLOT::Device::PGWin->new( { Device => $user_spec } );

  eval {

    for my $plot in ( qw/ plot1 plot2 / )
    {
      $pgwin->override( $plot );
      my $win = $pgwin->next();
      $win->env( ... );
      ...
    }
  };
  my $error = $@;
  $pgwin->finish;
  die $error if $error;
